#### Must-have behaviors to replicate (even with better relationships)

- **Catalog structure**: category/subcategory/drilldowns; MSI ordering (supports fractional/reorder)
- **Office scoping**: include/exclude MSIs per office
- **MSI contents**: options + upcharges; counts; “show switch” behavior
- **UpCharge applicability**: disabledParents logic (per option)
- **V2 pricing**:
  - per office
  - per typeCode breakdown
  - percentage pricing that targets specific base typeCodes
  - upcharge prices depend on parent option
- **Offline-first client**:
  - sync fingerprinting / diff logic
  - bulk fetch and pin
  - pricing must be computable locally
- **Import/export**:
  - ability to overwrite catalog via spreadsheet import (or API equivalent)
  - export for auditing/round-tripping
- **Bulk ops**:
  - mass copy fields and relational lists
  - mass price change
- **Template plumbing**:
  - placeholders and additional detail placeholder substitution (MSI + namespaced upcharge)
